# Ozone Time Series Analysis
My project involves conducting a comprehensive analysis of the changes in ozone levels over a period of 18 years (1955-1972) in downtown Los Angeles. This is a critical topic to address, as decreasing ozone levels can have adverse effects on human health by allowing harmful UV rays from the sun to penetrate the atmosphere. Therefore, it is essential to gain a deeper understanding of the factors that contribute to ozone changes and their potential impact on our environment.
